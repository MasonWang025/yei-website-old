            Note that this application process is highly competitive with a{" "}
            <i>{"<10%"} acceptance rate</i> for several positions â€” not all
            qualified applicants receive a position because we simply do not
            have the space! Applicants may be invited to several rounds of
            interviews before a final decision is made. We employ a holistic
            review process for each applicant and are looking for students who
            exhibit high levels of drive, initiative, enthusiasm, and
            commitment.
