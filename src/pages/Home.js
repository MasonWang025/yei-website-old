            EconClubs is YEIâ€™s signature program and is designed to help
            students launch economics clubs at their own schools. Every YEI
            EconClub is provided with our custom-designed AP/IB curriculum,
            mentorship from our global leadership team, exclusive access to
            certain YEI events, YEI brand recognition, and support from an
            international community of aspiring economists. Existing economics
            clubs are also welcome to join the EconClubs program.
